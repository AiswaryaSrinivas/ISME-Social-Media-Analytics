Churros was hard, pizza was pathetic, loaded nachos and masala Garlic bread were topped with cheese with MAYO! Yes mayonnese.. Soup has the bread crumbs in almost melted state, mocktails were average and our only Savior was pasta and caramel pudding... This place has high potential but let down by dull ambience, pretty slow and inattentive staff. Buffet price was listed as 399 but was charged 499, We still went ahead and took the deal to be very disappointed!! Most dishes were freshly cooked hence going with some starts else would rate them lower. I did not find a single person who seemed happy with their meal as moat complained about one thing or the other. That'll be my last visit San Churros.\")]</td>\n",

The lightings are just perfect.We went there on the occasion of Christmas and so they had only limited items available. But the taste and service was not compromised at all.The only complaint is that the breads could have been better.Would surely like to come here again.'), ('Rated 4.0', 'RATED\\n  I was here for dinner with my family on a weekday. The restaurant was completely empty. Ambience is good with some good old hindi music. Seating arrangement are good too. We ordered masala papad, panner and baby corn starters, lemon and corrionder soup, butter roti, olive and chilli paratha. Food was fresh and good, service is good too. Good for family hangout.\\nCheers'), ('Rated 2.0', 'RATED\\n  Its a restaurant near to Banashankari BDA.

Then came masala dosa, pulka,pulav, veg rice bath. Masala dosa was very very tasty. Service is bit fast as people will be coming, but they will make it slow if u tell them to. Then comes rice with sambar,rasam, daal,tambali. And yes, dont forget to eat holige,payasam and icecream. Service is very nice. One best thing is all of this comes in just 160 rs and its unlimited!!!

Good for family hangout.\\nCheers'), ('Rated 2.0', 'RATED\\n  Its a restaurant near to Banashankari BDA.

Was really tempted to try their Churros but we were stuffed. Worth a visit and try for sure!'), ('Rated 3.0', \"RATED\\n  Churros, the restaurant's eponymous offering, has to be tried. They're a Mexican snack and served with chocolate sauce. Milkshakes are good too. The interior walls have murals and writings all over. Haven't tried the pizzas here but the cakes and pastries were pretty good.\"), ('Rated 3.0', \"RATED\\n  Honestly, have only tried parcels and that too only starters and mains - never tried desserts. So this review is based on starters and mains only. The quality wasn't all that great, was pretty average.\"), ('Rated 4.0', \"RATED\\n  Visited this place for the first time, recently. The ambience was pretty good. We ordered two 'churros for two'. Having churros for the first time ever, I was way too excited and judgmental. But swear to Lord, the churros were heavenly! The chocolate sauce was the actual chocolate sauce and not nutella xD We had taken the Cross Country Ranch pizza. It was a thin crust pizza loaded with veggies.\\nThe place is famous for churros (the name suggests so). I would love to visit again to try all the other items out :')\"), ('Rated 4.0', 'RATED\\n  I love the desserts more than anything here !Good place and well served !:)\\nWe dint like the nachos here , it was not that good as we expected !\\nExcept nachos almost all dish were quite good!'), ('Rated 2.0', \"RATED\\n  2nd time I have visited this place and I am surprised to see how it has declined. Churros was hard, pizza was pathetic, loaded nachos and masala Garlic bread were topped with cheese with MAYO! Yes mayonnese.. Soup has the bread crumbs in almost melted state, mocktails were average and our only Savior was pasta and caramel pudding... This place has high potential but let down by dull ambience, pretty slow and inattentive staff. Buffet price was listed as 399 but was charged 499, We still went ahead and took the deal to be very disappointed!! Most dishes were freshly cooked hence going with some starts else would rate them lower. I did not find a single person who seemed happy with their meal as moat complained about one thing or the other. That'll be my last visit San Churros.\")]

The lightings are just perfect.We went there on the occasion of Christmas and so they had only limited items available. But the taste and service was not compromised at all.The only complaint is that the breads could have been better.Would surely like to come here again.   \n",
